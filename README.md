# multiver-archiver
This is a simple program written in c# that automatically puts the contents of your multiver file into a zip file. This is only for Windows, but could probably be adapted for other platforms fairly easily.
## Usage
Just run it. Then in your documents folder there will be a zip containing the files (preview is bugged with windows) in the folder `MultiverArchives`. The tool will automatically remove logs, caches, and some other useless stuff. It's perfectly runnable though.
